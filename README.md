 Resume2JobMatch - R2JM

An intelligent job matching system that **scores how well a resume fits a job description** ‚Äî powered by **SBERT embeddings** and **unsupervised XGBoost**.

## USP

Instead of relying on basic keyword overlaps, this system uses **contextual embeddings** to deeply understand resumes and job postings. It then applies **XGBoost** to compute how compatible they are ‚Äî giving you a smart relevance score.

## WORKING

1. **Preprocessing**
   Extract and clean text from resumes and job descriptions.

2. **Embedding Generation**
   Use `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (from `sentence-transformers`) to convert each text into semantic vectors.

3. **Scoring**
   Concatenate resume and job vectors, and pass them to a **ranking model trained with XGBoost** (unsupervised learning based on similarity scoring).

4. **Prediction**
   Upload a resume ‚Üí Fetch job listings ‚Üí Generate match scores ‚Üí Sorted results.
